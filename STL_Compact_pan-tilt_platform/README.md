**Mounting and Structure:**
The servo motors are positioned between two main structural parts, referred to as Face 1 and Face 2.
The Base serves as the anchor point for the first servo motor, allowing for smooth rotational motion.
An Arm is connected to the second servo motor and moves horizontally.

**Lidar Placement:** At the end of the Arm, a Lidar sensor is mounted, enabling precise scanning at various angles.

This setup enables controlled movement in both axes, providing a stable and adjustable mounting solution for applications requiring precise targeting or scanning.
